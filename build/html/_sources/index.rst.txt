Having said yes too many times in my professional spaces, it is a challenge to explain the sope of my experiences. Instead, this CV provides a focus through the lens of Technical Writing.

This means not showcasing project management, teaching, budgeting, and recruiting experience. Nor my successful navigation over 20 years of ongoing tight deadline cycles as a teacher, head of department, researcher, editor, software tester, data analyst, and author.

It also fails to convey the fun and challenges, get me to tell you about learning to ride a motorbike in the rainy season in a forest some time.
