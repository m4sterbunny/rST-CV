.. sidebar:: Mission
	"Be Humble. Work Hard" 
	    
	.. code-block :: text

		This mission has led me to work in 5 
		countries across 3 continents. 
		And remotely in more than 10 
		countries across 6 continents. 

		I show my humility by 
		asking all my dumb questions. 

		It is by asking my dumb questions, 
		listening to the answers, and working 
		with commitment, that I have had the
		opportunity to work with awesome people 
		–across a range of sectors. 

.. topic :: Summary
	
	An experienced technical writer and substantive editor; 
	skilled at making technical content 
	accessible to a wide audience. 

	I dabble in code and systems 
	for the simple joy 
	of understanding them.
